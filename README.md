# BerclazMayITSM

This project was carried out as part of the "634-1 COMP. & PATTERN" module.

## Installation

Just unzip the zip and open the two solutions files (.sln) in Visual Studio.

## Usage

You can open the two solution on two Visual Studio windows. You have an already created database at your disposal, **however the paths do not match (connection string).**
To test it, launch the WEPApi first (EFCoreApp2020.sln) and then the Client (webapiclient2.sln).
Then it's up to you to travel ;)

## Datas available for test (data from the db in the "DATABASE" folder)
